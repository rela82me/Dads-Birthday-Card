`dad-card` is a lightweight Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes tools and resources for Large Language Model (LLM) applications. It's designed to be a fun and practical example of how to provide specialized capabilities to AI agents, focusing on the timeless art of dad jokes and heartfelt messages.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dad Joke Tool**: On-demand dad jokes, ready to be integrated into any LLM-powered chat.
- **Dynamic Card Generator**: Create personalized digital card messages for various occasions.
- **MCP Compliant**: Built with `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to easily connect with MCP clients.
- **Configurable**: Uses `dotenv` to manage environment variables for easy setup.
- **Formatted Text**: Leverages `word-wrap` to ensure messages and jokes are perfectly formatted.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x or higher recommended)
- npm

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```sh

    cd dad-card
    ```

2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Configuration

Before running the server, you need to set up your environment variables.

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:

    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  Edit the `.env` file with your desired settings.

    ```dotenv
    # .env
    # Port for the MCP server (if using HTTP transport)
    PORT=3000

    # You can add other configurations here, like API keys for external services
    # DAD_JOKE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

### Running the Server

Start the MCP server with the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

The server will now be running and ready to accept connections from an MCP client, like the MCP Inspector.
